<p>Blogs are simple pieces of software. It&#8217;s the penultimate &#8220;sample application&#8221; that you build when learning frameworks like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. But what I&#8217;ve found is, the more familiar I am with writing and managing blogging applications, the less I have any interest in doing it. Everything is too heavyweight, with themes and databases and complex administrative interfaces. I found myself yearning for something simple, uncluttered, and under my control.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages">GitHub announced support for user pages</a> I knew in the back of my mind that this was going to be a big deal. At the time I didn&#8217;t really know how it could be used for a blog since it seemed to just serve up static pages, but I definitely liked what I was hearing. After a couple of months went by, I finally decided to take the plunge and see what I could accomplish. Surprisingly, everything I wanted in a blog!</p>
<h3>Dead Simple Publishing</h3>
<p>GitHub Pages are as simple as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a GitHub repository called yourname.github.com</li>
	<li>Push a &#8216;master&#8217; branch to that repository</li>
	<li>GitHub will automatically build your page using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jeyll">Jekyll</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may not have heard of Jekyll before (at least outside of the context of GitHub pages), but it is essentially an <span class="caps">HTML</span> generator that allows you to generate static <span class="caps">HTML</span> sites based on some very simple rules. Once you learn those rules, it&#8217;s extremely simple to build sites that can be deployed anywhere that can serve up <span class="caps">HTML</span> (no server-side required).</p>
<p>You can also use a <code>CNAME</code> to redirect your own domain to GitHub.</p>
<h3>What About Comments? Images?</h3>
<p>New tools have appeared that not only take care of all of the functionality I need for handling blog comments and image uploads, but do them better than any blog engine I have ever used.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> completely offloads blog post comments, and does a ridiculously good job of it. You get message threading, a great e-mail notification system, spam protection, and best of all it&#8217;s as simple as a Javascript include in your blog post template.</p>
<p>Images are easy enough to add to a directory structure, but I find it even easier to use <a href="http://www.skitch.com/">Skitch</a>, drag an image to it, webpost it, and then use the direct image <span class="caps">URL</span> to embed it in the post.</p>
<h3>Why Do It?</h3>
<p>I like using Ruby. I like writing my posts in Textile. I hate managing comments and complicated blog systems. If that sounds like you, you may want to look into outsourcing your own blog.</p>
